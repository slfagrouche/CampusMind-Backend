## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

Students in New York face several challenges when navigating the CUNY and SUNY systems:

- **Scattered Information**: Details about professors and courses are spread across multiple platforms
- **Outdated Data**: Official websites often contain outdated or incomplete professor information
- **Time-Consuming Research**: Students waste hours trying to find reliable professor reviews and course details
- **Decision Paralysis**: With so many options across 60+ campuses, students struggle to make informed decisions

This AI-powered solution brings all this information together in one place, providing students with reliable, up-to-date information they can trust.

## üß† API Architecture

The CUNY/SUNY AI Assistant API is built with a focus on performance, scalability, and responsible AI design:

- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for different types of queries:
  - Transfer Agent: Handles transfer-related queries between institutions
  - Professor Agent: Provides information about professors, courses, and ratings
  - Recommendation Agent: Offers school recommendations based on student interests
  - Browser Agent: General information retrieval for queries that don't fit other categories

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: 
  - Knowledge base built from official CUNY/SUNY documentation
  - FAISS vector store for semantic search
  - DuckDuckGo integration for real-time web search
  - MongoDB integration for structured professor and school data

- **LLM Provider Management**:
  - Load-balanced across multiple LLM providers (Groq, Cerebras, Together AI)
  - Fallback mechanisms for API reliability
  - Metadata tracking for model usage and attribution

- **Responsible AI**:
  - Content safety filtering for both queries and responses
  - Comprehensive policy enforcement
  - Source attribution for all information
  - Clear metadata about model usage

```yaml
---
title: CUNY/SUNY AI Assistant
emoji: üéì
colorFrom: blue
colorTo: indigo
sdk: docker

## üõ°Ô∏è Responsible AI Implementation

### Content Safety

The system includes a comprehensive content safety filter that:

1. **Pre-checks queries** for policy violations before processing
2. **Post-checks responses** to ensure outputs conform to safety guidelines
3. **Returns safe alternatives** when responses might violate policies

### Custom Policy Implementation

The content safety filter uses a detailed policy (defined in `app/policies.py`) that covers:

- **O1: Illegal or harmful activities**: Preventing generation of content related to illegal activities, violence, etc.
- **O2: Child safety**: Protecting minors by filtering inappropriate content
- **O3: Privacy and personal data**: Refusing to provide non-public personal data
- **O4: Political and societal content**: Maintaining neutrality on controversial topics
- **O5: Financial and legal advice**: Disclaiming professional financial or legal advice
- **O6: cation-specific concerns**: Special considerations for the cation domain

### Source Attribution

All information provided includes source attributions:

- **Knowledge base sources**: Document name and page number
